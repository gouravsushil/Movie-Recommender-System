# Movie Recommender System

This is a content-based movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques. The system recommends movies based on the similarity of their descriptions, leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Features
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transforms movie descriptions into numerical vectors.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between vectors to recommend movies.
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on their textual descriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
2. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The dataset consists of movie descriptions (titles, genres, plots, etc.). Make sure the dataset is in CSV format with a column for movie descriptions. You can use your own dataset or download a public dataset like the MovieLens dataset.

Future Improvements
Incorporate additional features like user ratings, genres, or actors.
Explore deep learning techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) for more advanced text embeddings.
Scale the system for larger datasets and real-time recommendations.
